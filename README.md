# SSGF

This is all old code I wrote when I worked under Professor Tarek Hassan for his SSGF (Social Structure of Governments and Firms) project.

It is messy, as most of this was directly uploaded from my Desktop to GitHub. I have not touched this code in over a year, and parts of it were run in Stata from a computer that I no longer have access to.

These are primarily scrapers for Wikipedia and a website called rulers.org. I used these to get data on birth dates, term lengths, and history of heads of governments and their cabinet members.

The directory of names was taken from the CIA rulers handbook.

The majority of data analysis was done in Stata (which I don't have access to).
